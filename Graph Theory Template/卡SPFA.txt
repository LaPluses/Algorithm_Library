Following is a way to construct a data to defeat this algorithm (without queue optimization???).[1] Suppose one wants the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex n. Then we can add edge (i, i + 1) with a small random weight for 1 ¡Ü i < n (thus the shortest path should be 1-2-...-n), and randomly add 4n other heavy edges. For this case, the so-called SPFA algorithm will be very slow.
